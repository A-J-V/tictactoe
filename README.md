After my overly complicated first attempt at training an RL-powered Hnefatafl agent failed, I threw together this TicTacToe environment to serve as a sanity check to ensure I understood the algorithms involved.
It serves as an ultra basic environment just to sanity check algorithms on an incredibly simple game before trying to implement them for more complex projects.
