# TicTacToe Reinforcement Learning Testbed

I threw together this TicTacToe environment to serve as a sanity check to ensure I understood the algorithms involved.

It serves as an ultra basic environment just to check algorithms on an incredibly simple game before trying to implement them for more complex projects.

I used this to test a basic implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization.
